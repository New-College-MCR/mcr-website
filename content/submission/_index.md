# Guideline for Submissions to the New Collection

The New Collection is open to all disciplines, and both review and research articles are accepted for submission to the journal. All members of the MCR and those who have recently graduated are encouraged to submit.

Submissions should be sent to new.collection.mcr@gmail.com; no hard copy submissions are accepted. Please use whatever reference style is appropriate for your discipline. Authors will have the choice of whether or not they would like their submissions considered working papers whereby readers are asked not to cite the work without the author's permission. This is to help ensure that publication in The New Collection does not preclude publication elsewhere.

 

### Review Process:

The New Collection uses a double peer-review process; articles are first reviewed by the editorial team composed of members of the MCR, and subsequently by reviewers from the SCR. The aim of the review process is to ensure that all articles best demonstrate the broad spectrum of the research currently being undertaken at New College, are accessible to a general academic audience, and are academically rigorous.
