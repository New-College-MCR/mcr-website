New College typically accommodates most of its graduates for their first year, with a reasonable chance of a second year in college accommodation. In particular, non-UK graduates will almost always be housed in college accommodation for their first year. Oxford University graduates are not guaranteed accommodation in college but will often still be offered housing for their first year.

## Living in college

New College has graduate accommodation at 2 different sites: the Weston Buildings and Castle Mill.
### Weston buildings

The Weston buildings contain the majority of the New College graduate accommodation: they consist of 16 houses, each with 6 rooms. They are located on the college sports grounds, about a 5 minute walk from college itself. Each room is a single study bedroom; the bathrooms are not ensuite, but there are 3 bath/shower rooms per house, meaning each is shared between only 2 people. Laundry facilities are available on-site, and the MCR is located here.

### Castle Mill

College also supplements its graduate accommodation by renting 16 rooms in blocks F and G of the University's Castle Mill site. This is located near the train station, on the west side of Oxford, and is very convenient for the Said Business school and the exciting bars and pubs of the Jericho district. It is slightly further from the college and MCR than Weston, but still no more than a 10 minute cycle ride (and in Oxford bikes are more common than cars...). The rooms are all modern and en suite. For more information on the Castle Mill site, please see http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/graduateaccommodation/graduate/properties/castlemill/.

## Graduate Housing Ballot

Returning graduates (i.e. non-freshers) have the opportunity to apply for college accommodation each year.The ballot is fundamentally run by college, but the MCR secretary (see Committee page) liases with college and passes on the relevant information to the MCR.

Typically around the end of March, you will receive an email containing within it an application form for the housing ballot along with (hopefully) all the relevant details. The deadline for the ballot application itself will be approximately 2 weeks later, around or just before the start of Trinity Term.

Usually there are around 25 rooms reserved for returning graduates; the rest are mostly for incoming freshers. These rooms are distributed between Weston and Castle Mill (see main accommodation page for further details on these locations). If you don't initially get a room, do not despair: you will be placed on a waiting list, and it is relatively common for a number of people with rooms to later pull out.

Your position on the ballot will depend on how many years you have already lived in college accommodation, with priority given to those who have never lived in college. The highest priority is given to students entering their final year who have never lived in college accommodation.

Whilst it is generally not encouraged, it is possible if necessary to withdraw from the ballot. It is, however, much harder to do the reverse.

For questions about the ballot itself, feel free to contact the MCR secretary. For any questions about accommodation, your best bet is to contact college (Emily Meeson, Sue Fisher) directly, although the MCR house officer will be happy to help if possible.
