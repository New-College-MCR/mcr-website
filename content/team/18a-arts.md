Giulia is doing a DPhil in History. She joined the MCR Committee back in 2018 undertaking the role of LGBTQ+ Rep and Sports Rep. Currently she is our Arts & Culture Representative, which among other things means that she is in charge of board games, videogame consoles and musical instruments at the Pavilion. Together with Valentino she also organises subsidised cultural events for the MCR. Feel free to get in touch at giulia.bernardini@new.ox.ac.uk if you have questions or suggestions on what to get for the MCR. Alternatively, the easiest way to track Giulia is to leave a trail of snacks leading to the PlayStation in the TV room at the Weston Pavilion.
