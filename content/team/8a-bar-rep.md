Alexia is doing a masters degree in business law and can weirdly spend hours explaining how taxation is fascinating. As co-bar rep, youâ€™ll have a good chance of getting her in behind the bar, cleaning up and practicing how to pour the perfect pint. If not, she will be trying out every Oxford library, running, rowing or - even better - running to the Isis to row because she is late.
