Howdy y’all ! my name's Alysia (uh-lee-see-yuh) and I hail from the great state of Texas and a cute lil city called Dallas. I’m a first year MSc studying Experimental Therapeutics (i.e. clinical trials) and I’m very excited for this year and feel privileged to serve such an incredible group of people (:
