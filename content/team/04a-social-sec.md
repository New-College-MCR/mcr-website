Hi! I'm Ciara and I'm doing an MSt in German literature. I spend most of my time convincing people that Kafka is funny, but can otherwise be found at the MCR bar pretending to know how to play darts (pictured), attempting to juggle at Bops, or guilt-tripping people into coming to 'crafternoons'. If you see a random ball of yarn anywhere in Oxford, it's probably mine.
