I’m a PGCE student and I specialise in History. For my undergraduate degree, I researched and wrote about the disability rights movement under Margaret Thatcher’s governments. I am a first generation and estranged student. I have previously worked on the first Global Ministerial Mental Health Event, and with the Children’s Society.
