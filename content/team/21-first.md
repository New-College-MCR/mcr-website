Dorian is reading for a DPhil in Organic Chemistry, where he investigates the development of new antibiotics. When he is not in the lab, he enjoys visiting museums, seeing a play at the theater, or just going on a walk to Port Meadows. 

As a First Year Rep, Dorian organizes movie nights and makes sure that all freshers are fairly represented on the MCR committee.
