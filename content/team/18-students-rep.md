Marjun is reading for a MSc in International Human Rights Law. In his non-Oxford life, Marjun practises law as a litigator in London, but youâ€™ll otherwise find him drinking his eighth coffee of the day, causing havoc while coxing on the river or going for long runs to ruminate over why he thought that juggling a full-time job with a part-time degree was a good idea.
