Sophie is doing the BCL in Law, focusing on International Human Rights and Environmental Law. As Welfare Officer, she helps contribute positively to the wellbeing of the New College MCR Committee. When not locked in the library reading hundreds of pages of cases, she can be found disturbing her flatmates with her loud singing or watching really bad reality TV.
