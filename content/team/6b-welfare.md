Elena is currently doing my DPhil in History. She likes to spend my days immersed in history books among dusty library shelves, but you will also find me on a football pitch or playing the violin (or at least trying to!). As Welfare Officer officer, she aims to create a community where everyone can feel at home. Whether you have concerns to address or simply want a friendly chat, feel free to reach out to her.
