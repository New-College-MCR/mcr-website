Valentino is reading for a MSt in Greek and Latin Languages and Literature.  As Art and Culture rep, he is responsible for MCR culture, e.g. poetry nights, theatre nights, exhibitions, the MCR library. He would like to encourage more inclusive and cross-cultural discussion on art, as well as to provide a space for reflection on LGBTIAQ+ culture.
