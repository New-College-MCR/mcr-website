Gabi is a DPhil student in the Interdisciplinary Biosciences DTP, with undergraduate and masters degrees in physics (though be warned it was the experimental kind, so your bike may emit strange radiation after he's done with it). As bike rep he maintains the MCRâ€™s fleet of bicycles which are free for members to borrow. If you have a bike problem, feel free to ask him for tips!
