Noémie is pursuing a Master in English literature and English-French translation and she hopes that google translation and other robots won’t steal her job.
She can be found almost at all times in the NC library writing essays; when she isn’t there she is probably listening to abba whilst missing her cats and drinking tea or eating cheese and playing video games.
