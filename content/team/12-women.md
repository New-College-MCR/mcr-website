Breanne is a DPhil student in Zoology studying wild chimpanzee behaviour in Uganda. When she isn’t running around the world chasing primates of all types, she enjoys music, reading, and generally being outdoors.

As women’s officer, she is responsible for representing the interests of self-identifying women within the MCR. She aims to promote inclusivity and be available to all women to support them through any issues they may be facing during their time at Oxford, either as an ear to listen or as an advocate for possible solutions. She will also curate and communicate events across Oxford aimed at women and organise smaller events specifically for the MCR.
