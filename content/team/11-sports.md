Giulia is doing a DPhil in History in the spare time when she's not playing as striker for the New College Women's Football Club. Understandably bored of being secluded in dusty archives, she decided to join the MCR Committee back in 2018 undertaking the role of LGBTQ+ Rep before moving on to Sports Rep. Her job is to make sure that the MCR is equipped with rackets, croquet clubs, balls, dumbbells and much more, as well as keeping you up to date with the latest news regarding sports facilities available to you at New College. If you have any question related to sports activities on college grounds (including punts!), feel free to get in touch via email at giulia.bernardini@new.ox.ac.uk. Alternatively, the easiest way to track Giulia is to leave a trail of snacks leading to the PlayStation in the TV room at the Weston Pavilion.
