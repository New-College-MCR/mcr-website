Hi y’all! My name is Han, and I am the E&D Rep for the New College MCR. I grew up in the USA in the suburbs of Dallas, TX, and I did my undergrad at UCLA. Right now, I’m pursuing an MSc in Statistical Science. Outside of academics, I love playing chess and watching nature documentaries. (Planet Earth III is out now!!)
