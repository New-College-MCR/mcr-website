Elena is currently doing my DPhil in History. She likes to spend my days immersed in history books among dusty library shelves, but you will also find me on a football pitch or playing the violin (or at least trying to!). As LGBTQ+ officer, she aims to create a community where everyone can feel at home in shared spaces.
