Mizy is reading for an MSt in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. When he's not reading wacky queer/trans theory, he can be found asleep (with a philosophy podcast playing in the background) or out on a long walk. Mizy's main goal is to create a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ+ people at NC and is always available for a chatâ€“very little phases him, so do reach out if you ever need a listening ear.
