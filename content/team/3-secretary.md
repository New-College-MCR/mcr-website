Steffen is reading for a DPhil in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems, a topic that is too trendy for how much mathematics it involves. Apart from labouring over equations and code, he sweats through various workouts and might row again next year. Having recently discovered mindfulness, you might spot him sitting very still on a bench outside.
