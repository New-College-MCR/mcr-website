Valentino is reading for a MSt in Greek and Latin Languages and Literature.  As Art and Culture rep, Valentino works along with Giulia (see also: Mario and Luigi) to organise cultural events in the MCR, such as poetry nights, theatre nights, or exhibitions, and is responsible for the MCR library. He would like to encourage more inclusive and cross-cultural discussion on art, as well as to provide a space for reflection on LGBTIAQ+ culture.
