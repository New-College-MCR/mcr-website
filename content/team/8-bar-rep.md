Eloise is currently reading for an MPhil in Greek Literature and Language. Some of you may know them from their tenure as LGBTQ+ rep, but they're now back and better than ever with much more alcohol at their disposal (and some fancy soft drinks too)- you will likely find them frantically writing essays behind the bar.
