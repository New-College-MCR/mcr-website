I'm Cieran, a mathematics teaching intern (PGCE) at the Department of Education, and I'm the first generation to come to university in my family. I'm a disabled student myself and come from a family with a long history of disabled family members and supporting disabled chairites. My interest include recreational mathematics, sailing, and supporting the Welsh rugby team.
