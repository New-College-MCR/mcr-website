My Name is Cieran Leigh, I am a mathematics teaching intern (PGCE) at the Department of Education; and I am your Disability Representative on the New College MCR. I am first generation to come to university in my family and the first to come to Oxford. I come from a family with a long history of disabled family members and supporting disabled chairites, as a disabled student myself and my mother is also a disabled mature student, currently studying at the University of Manchester. I am open about being Neuroatypical and my struggle with both dyslexia and dyspraxia aswell as the ASD diagnostic process. I have also experienced education with severe visual impairments and understand the impact this has on education, especially with the high reliance on reading at postgraduate level. Being Disabled I understand better than most the impact disabilities can have on education, from not only access to higher education perspective, but the support during our studies and on a personal basis. I am here to support abled and disabled students alike and am hoping to offer perspective to the committee and wider college body where disabled students may inadvertently be overlooked.
