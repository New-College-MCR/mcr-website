Through my DPhil in Neuroscience, I try to understand why psychedelics can help people heal in various contexts and I study how they work using computational modeling of brain dynamics. In my role as LGBTQ+ rep, I hope to help create an environment in which no LGBTQ+ rep is necessary anymore. Outside my research, I love to dance and be involved in Oxfordâ€™s many societies.
