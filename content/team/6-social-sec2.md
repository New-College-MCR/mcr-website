Alex is Head of Operations of Ufonia, an Oxford University Innovation Startup developing natural-language artificial intelligence for clinical settings. She's also an Admitted Attorney of the High Court of South Africa, and is now reading for the MSt in International Human Rights Law having previously completed her economics and LLB degrees at the University of Cape Town. Alex is passionate about using tech to solve complex challenges in health and law in order to help make people's lives easier.

In her spare time during the pandemic she watched countless hours of Netflix, cooked just-above-average food, started many books she never finished, and endlessly scrolled for memes. Sheâ€™s looking forward to organising fun (and Covid-safe) social events for the MCR, so she can hang out with real people again.
