Makiko is doing an MPhil in International Relations. Born in Japan, she has spent most of her life abroad in the States, Switzerland, and the UK, and she considers Oxford one of her favourite places in the world. When she is not discussing IR theories and historical evidence, she sings in the Oxford Belles, Oxford’s oldest all-female a cappella group. She loves Broadway musicals, Disney films, and British comedies (especially Blackadder!) and is always excited to meet new people.

As Social Secretary, Makiko organises events for the MCR community, a task she finds particularly meaningful as the pandemic has shown us the value of staying connected. If you have any events you’d like to see or would just like a chat, please do get in touch!
