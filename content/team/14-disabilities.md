Malina is doing a DPhil in Clinical Neurosciences and spends her days trying to keep her neuronal cell cultures alive and looking in awe at microscopy pictures. In her free time, Malina enjoys making music, baking, photography, chatting about important and unimportant things, and chocolate.

Malina represents MCR students with disabilities in the MCR committee, New College, and the university. This includes all kinds of disability, such as physical, mental, sensory, cognitive, or developmental, whether recognised or not. As your disability rep Malina will be someone to talk to if you need a chat about how your MCR, college, and the university can support you better and how to go about getting the support you need.
