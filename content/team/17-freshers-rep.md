Zach is pursuing an MSc in Higher Education with a focus on American educational policy. He was born and raised in Ohio, but he is not unfamiliar with Oxford as he completed his undergrad at Miami University (the Paris of the Midwest). In his free time, he enjoys wine, food, and sports, and if you combine all three it's probably the best day of his life (repeatable).
