Paula Larsson is in her final year of a doctoral degree in the History of Medicine. Born in Canada, her research focuses on the history of vaccine policy over the past century. She is founder and director of Uncomfortable Oxford, a student led enterprise that seeks to raise awareness of local histories of inequality and discrimination. In her free time, she is an enthusiastic writer and story-teller, and enjoys playing board games of all types. Although terrible at croquet, she can never refuse when challenged.
