Russell is doing a DPhil in Robotics Engineering which, hopefully, will be the last career to be completely automated. As a result of the pandemic he has found new passions in sourdough, gardening and discovering the UK through hiking and camping.

As the Bike Rep, Russell maintains the MCR's fleet of bicycles which are free for members to borrow. He also organizes bike repair workshops during term where members can tune up and repair their bikes for free or very little cost.
