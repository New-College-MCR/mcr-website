George is a clinical medicine student from North Yorkshire. He mostly spends his time telling his patients to cut down on alcohol and eat healthier, then supplies our students with plenty of wine and cheese when he gets home. In his free time he loves spending time outdoors doing sport, cooking, and scouring the reduced aisle and fb marketplace for deals.
