Ufuk is reading for an MPhil in Economics and spends his days scribbling cryptic equations on his oversized whiteboard. In his free time, he can be found playing basketball, reading and writing in the New College cloisters, or having joyful banter with our porter Stewart.

As Vice-President, Ufuk advises the president, runs committee elections, and is responsible for the academic community within the MCR. He also organizes Freshers' Fortnight and examines the accounts of our treasurer in excruciating detail.
