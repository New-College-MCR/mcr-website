Amalie is reading for an MPhil in European Politics and Society. As Bar Rep, she keeps the MCR bar well-stocked and running smoothly for any other MCR members who need to procrastinate. She's always on the lookout for new recommendations for drinks to add to the bar's stock for any student who needs to drown their sorrows.
