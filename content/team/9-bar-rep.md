Amalie is reading for an MPhil in European Politics and Society, which makes her a very dedicated committee member when she's got an essay she's trying to avoid. Her procrastination has driven her to be Bar Rep, keeping the MCR bar well-stocked and running smoothly for any other MCR members who need to procrastinate.

When not serving drinks and restocking the bar, she is a keen rower and will try to recruit you to the boat club. She is lactose-intolerant and doesn't like cheese, which makes her Lorenzo's arch-nemesis. She's always on the lookout for new recommendations for drinks to add to the bar's stock for any student who needs to drown their sorrows.
