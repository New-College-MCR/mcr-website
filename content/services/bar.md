We have the (arguably) cheapest bar in Oxford, run by the community, always providing a good time as well as a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

## Become a volunteer

You’ve sampled our abundant collection of drinks, but feel like you still have more to contribute?

… Then sign-up to be a MCR bar volunteer!

Bar volunteers need to be bar trained in order to work the bar at bar nights and bops. Training takes around 30 min. and there is no minimum commitment - you can volunteer as many (or as few) times as you’d like!

__Why should I volunteer?__

To quote the best song to come out of Norway in the 20th C and the unofficial motto of the bar [“Beer, Beer and more Beer - it’s the most beautiful thing I know”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJOAvmQ7FW0)!

In all seriousness - It’s a load of fun, and a great way to get involved with the MCR community, bar volunteers also have the privilege of free drinks (within reason!!!) while they are on shift. 

__‘How can I sign up?’, you ask!__
