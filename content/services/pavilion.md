Our MCR Pavillion is a beautiful building for any student of the MCR to enjoy at any moment's notice! Our MCR facilities are one of the few common rooms that are fully accessible, containing a common space with a bar and our TV room.

## The Spoom

![Bar](/images/nc/soiree.jpg)

Our main share space is the "Rew Nooner Spoom", named after our former warden [Reverend Spooner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Archibald_Spooner). 
Here, you will find fellow members drinking till closing time on the bi-weekly bar nights on Wed and Fri (more drinking details [here](/services/bar/)).
You'll find a piano in the corner, a doorway to the MCR Kitchen (beholding the sacred coffee machine and tea collection), a flat-screen TV to communally enjoy the current sports match. 

## TV room

After several refurbishment iterations, we finally nailed the perfect vibe for you and your homies when you walk in and crash on the bouncy, comfy red couches, plopped right in front of a nice TV. Your leisure can range from something as simple as watching a movie or TV show on a great sound system to playing from our selection of video games. 
The room is also the main access point for borrowing various items (details found [here](/services/borrowing/)).


## Accessibility

Our MCR aims to be fully-accessible to all those who enter. We have automated doors that can be activated by bod card or buttons. We have an elevator that takes you up from the G/F to 1/F. We have accessible toilets, and an open-minded committee willing to go above and beyond to make sure as many accessibility needs are fulfilled!
