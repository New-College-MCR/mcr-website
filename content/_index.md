# New College MCR

The New College Middle Common Room is made up of over 300 students from nearly 60 countries around the world, studying everything from Greek tragedy to planetary astrophysics. 

No matter where you are in your intellectual journey, your time at Oxford ought to be a challenging and rewarding experience, and the MCR is here to help you get the most out of it. Please feel free to reach out to me or any other Committee member with questions, comments, or suggestions about college life or Oxford in general.
