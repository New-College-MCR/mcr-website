      <h1 class="title">Housing</h1>
      <div class="content"><p>New College typically accommodates most of its graduates for their first year, with a reasonable chance of a second year in college accommodation. In particular, non-UK graduates will almost always be housed in college accommodation for their first year. Oxford University graduates are not guaranteed accommodation in college but will often still be offered housing for their first year.</p>

<h2 id="living-in-college">Living in college</h2>
<p>New College has graduate accommodation at the Weston Buildings site on St. Cross Road.</p>
<h3 id="weston-buildings">Weston buildings</h3>
<p>The Weston buildings consist of 16 houses, each with 6 rooms. They are located on the college sports grounds, about a 5 minute walk from college itself. Each room is a single study bedroom; the bathrooms are not ensuite, but there are 3 bath/shower rooms per house, meaning each is shared between only 2 people. Laundry facilities are available on-site, and the MCR is located here.</p>
<h2 id="graduate-housing-ballot">Graduate Housing Ballot</h2>
<p>Returning graduates (i.e. non-freshers) have the opportunity to apply for college accommodation each year. The ballot is fundamentally run by college, but the MCR secretary (see Committee page) liases with college and passes on the relevant information to the MCR.</p>
<p>Typically around the middle of Hilary, you will receive an email containing within it an application form for the housing ballot along with (hopefully) all the relevant details. The deadline for the ballot application itself will be approximately 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>Usually there are around 13 rooms reserved for returning graduates; the rest are mostly for incoming freshers. If you don&rsquo;t initially get a room, do not despair: you will be placed on a waiting list, and it is relatively common for a number of people with rooms to later pull out.</p>
<p>Your position on the ballot will depend on how many years you have already lived in college accommodation, with priority given to those who have never lived in college. The highest priority is given to students entering their final year who have never lived in college accommodation.</p>
<p>Whilst it is generally not encouraged, it is possible if necessary to withdraw from the ballot. It is, however, much harder to do the reverse.</p>
<p>For questions about the ballot itself, feel free to contact the MCR secretary. For any questions about accommodation, your best bet is to contact college (Emily Meeson) directly, although the MCR house officer will be happy to help if possible.</p>
<h2 id="weston-lodge">Weston Lodge</h2>
<p>Opening Times</p>
<p>The Weston lodge operates standard opening hours during term time (weeks 0-9) and remains open outside of term with alternative opening hours. During the college closure (Christmas and two weeks in August) the lodge is closed as well. The main lodge remains open 24/7 throughout the year.</p>
<p>Opening times during term time (weeks 0-9)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday: 10am - 3pm</li>
<li>Monday: 8am - 9:30pm</li>
<li>Tuesday: 8am - 9:30pm</li>
<li>Wednesday: 8am - 12am</li>
