        <div class="content"><p>Ahoy, intrepid sailors and fearless canalfarers! It is your Vice Admiral of Punts speaking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nc/punt.jpg" alt="Bar"></p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-punting">Introduction to punting</h2>
<p>New College owns a glorious fleet of FIVE punts that can be used during Trinity term by every member of college, including associate members.</p>
<p>Knowing the instructions on how to use the punts is not only tremendously helpful, it is also a mandatory requirement to punt at New College.</p>
<p>If you have never punted before, make the most of your New College membership and give it a try! Punting is one of the most characteristic activities to do at this university, usually done in groups of 2-4 people (equipped with lots of Pimm&rsquo;s, of course!) and it is a lovely way to spend a sunny day outdoors in Oxford, exploring the city from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Our punt &ldquo;harbor&rdquo; is located on the canal on the right side of the College&rsquo;s Sports Ground at Weston.</p>
<p>Punts are usually available from the beginning of May (when the weather allows) until the end of Trinity term, as per college regulations.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-book">How to book</h2>
<p>Five punts are available for booking. They can be booked by any member of New College by getting in touch with the porters at the Weston Lodge. This can be done either by visiting the lodge in person or by booking via phone at this number: 01865 281081</p>
<p>Bookings can be made for the following day only and are not permitted any further in advance of then (except for Sunday bookings that can be made from Friday).</p>
<p>No person may book several punts at once. Maximum of 4 people allowed per punt.</p>
<h2 id="booking-times">Booking times</h2>
<p>The available booking times are:</p>
<p>Monday to Friday: 09:00 – 12:00; 12:00 – 15:00; 15:00 – 18:00; 18:00 – 21:00.
Saturday: 10:00 – 12:00; 12:00 – 15:00;  15:00 – 18:00 and 18:00 – 21:00.
Sunday: 12:00 – 14:30; 14:30 – 18:00 and 18:00 – 21:00.</p>
<p>One booking can be made per day.</p>
<p>Remember that the end of your session is the time you must return the keys to the lodge.  So please account for mooring the punt back up, sanitising all the equipment and locking it away in the shed.</p>
<p>For the last session on weekdays and Saturday this means that keys must be returned to the lodge by 9pm, before it closes. On Sunday the lodge closes earlier at 3pm.  So please collect your key set before 3pm and return it by pushing it through the letter box when you are finished. Ignoring these rules can lead to fines.</p>
<h2 id="fines-and-misuse-of-punts">Fines and misuse of punts</h2>
<p>There are various ways you can get fined for abusing the punt system:</p>
<p>Late key return: If you fail to bring the key back when your session is over, you will be fined £2 for every 15 minutes you are late, up to a maximum of £20.</p>
<p>Punt misuse: Please report any lost or damaged equipment and problems with the sets of locks and keys to the Weston Lodge porters immediately. If you fail to report this, you are likely to be charged for it (poles and paddles cost upwards of £50). Failure to report damage done by a previous group could also lead to you being charged, and any damage found to be due to deliberate misuse will incur a larger fine.</p>
<p>Punt use while ineligible: If you have no interest in using the punts you have the option of signing out of the Punt Charge that will be battled (£6) in summer. To opt out please email Linda Goodsell (<a href="mailto:linda.goodsell@new.ox.ac.uk">linda.goodsell@new.ox.ac.uk</a>) and copy the Punt Vice-Admiral in (aka the MCR Sports Rep). If you have unsubscribed from the Punt Charge but are found using them, you will be fined £50 on battels.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-punts-a-7-steps-guide">Using the punts: a 7 steps guide</h2>
<p>With each punt you are allocated one paddle, one pole and 4 cushions. There is a padlock system to keep the equipment safe in the shed and to make sure you use the right set. Please follow these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Collect your key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange your New College Bod card at the Weston Lodge for a punt key set</li>
<li>The keys are attached to ducks to keep them afloat if they are dropped in the river</li>
<li>Your duck is labelled for the punt number you booked (1 to 5)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Open the punt shed</strong></p>
<p>Open lock with the keys provided to access the punt shed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Unlock your paddle and pole</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The equipment racks are labelled 1 to 5 corresponding to your punt number</li>
<li>The same key on your duck unlocks both the corresponding paddle and pole - it will not unlock any of the other equipment</li>
<li>Before use, please disinfect both paddle and pole with the provided cleaning supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose your cushions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take four cushions from the storage racks at the back of the punt shed and disinfect them as well.</li>
<li>Two larger sized cushions are appropriate for sitting on, and two of the smaller sized cushions are used for resting against the seat backs</li>
<li>Please resist the urge to take more cushions because there are only enough for four per punt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Close the punt shed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the padlocks should remain within the shed so lock them back as you found them onto the correct latches</li>
<li>Remember to lock the punt shed doors with the combination lock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Unmoor your punt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is much easier to board your punt and set up your cushions, snacks and booze while the punt is still moored to the bank</li>
<li>The last person should unlock the punt chain with the second key on your duck</li>
<li>Please relock the padlock to the mooring rings rather than taking them on the punt because they will inevitably get lost!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7: Returning the equipment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please clean the equipment used after use. Seat pads, poles etc need to be cleaned after use with disinfectant spray, dried with paper towels and all rubbish disposed yourselves.</li>
<li>The paper bin in the shed is used to trash used paper towels ONLY. Other garbage can be disposed of at the bin shed beside the MCR Pavilion.</li>
<li>Please lock everything back up as you found it when you return from your punting sessions including the punt shed doors</li>
<li>You can moor your punt to any of the rings, but the paddles and poles MUST be placed back in the appropriate latch of the corresponding punt number</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy punting!</p>
<p>Giulia Bernardini</p>
<p>Vice-Admiral of Punts &amp; MCR Sports Rep 2020-21</p>
